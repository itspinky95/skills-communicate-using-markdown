Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using simple and easy-to-read syntax. Here's an explanation of the most commonly used Markdown syntax:

1. Headers:
   - Use the `#` symbol followed by a space to create headers. The number of `#` symbols indicates the header level, with one `#` for the largest header and six `#` symbols for the smallest.
   - Example: `# Header 1`, `## Header 2`, `### Header 3`, and so on.

2. Emphasis:
   - Use asterisks `*` or underscores `_` to italicize text.
   - Use double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` to bold text.
   - Example: `*italic*`, `_italic_`, `**bold**`, `__bold__`.

3. Lists:
   - Use hyphens `-`, plus signs `+`, or asterisks `*` followed by a space to create unordered lists.
   - Use numbers followed by a period and a space to create ordered lists.
   - Example:
     ```
     - Item 1
     - Item 2
       - Subitem 1
       - Subitem 2
     1. First item
     2. Second item
     ```

4. Links:
   - Use square brackets `[]` to define the anchor text and parentheses `()` to provide the URL.
   - Example: `[Google](https://www.google.com)`

5. Images:
   - Similar to links, but with an exclamation mark `!` at the beginning.
   - Example: `![Alt text](image_url)`

6. Blockquotes:
   - Use the greater than `>` symbol followed by a space to create blockquotes.
   - Example: `> This is a blockquote.`

7. Code:
   - Use backticks \` to denote inline code.
   - Use triple backticks \`\`\` to denote code blocks. You can also specify the language after the opening triple backticks for syntax highlighting.
   - Example:
     ```
     Inline code: `code here`
     ```
     ```javascript
     // Code block
     function greet(name) {
         console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
     }
     ```

8. Horizontal Rule:
   - Use three or more hyphens `-`, asterisks `*`, or underscores `_` to create a horizontal rule.
   - Example: `---`, `***`, `___`

9. Links and Images:
   - Links are created using square brackets for the anchor text and parentheses for the URL.
   - Images are created using an exclamation mark followed by square brackets for alt text and parentheses for the URL.

These are the basic Markdown syntax elements. There are additional features and extensions available, but these cover the fundamentals.
